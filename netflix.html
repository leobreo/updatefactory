            <div id="various-playlists" class="column">
                Netflix does categorize movies and helps you to navigate through content. However one might want to sort their favoured movies into different situations and feelings. Therefore we propose an update which allows users to create playlists for specific purposes.

            <h2>Connectiong and recommending</h2>
            <div id="connecting" class="column">
                Netflix is missing a feature to find and stay in touch with friends on the basis of movies. If one could recommend movies to others or plan movies together watching movies would become a totally different experience since it would not only be about purely watching but also about the connection and communication with others that comes with it.
